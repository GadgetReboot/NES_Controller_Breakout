# NES_Controller_Breakout
NES 7 pin controller jack to 0.1" pin header breakout board
<BR><BR>
This pcb takes right angle 7 pin NES controller jacks and provides all pins on a 0.1 inch pitch pin header.<br>
The connectors were obtained on AliExpress https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeBYg1V
There are non right angle versions also, which have a different row spacing between the two rows of pins.<br>
It is best to obtain the exact connectors being used first, verify the measurements of the pin spacings, row spacing, pin diameter, and the plastic peg spacing and diameter.<br>
Then compare the measurements against the pcb design in case the specs have changed on the connector.
